traceBREEZE.sh  traceCU360.sh    traceK1xx.sh    traceRC.sh     traceXT.sh

New features:
	added support for compressed files
	added more types of input such as folders, phonereports, debugreports, LogReports and Logarchives	
	added -A option to explore all logfiles in the provided input let it be a folder or a LogReport
	added -C option to concatenate all files in chronological order into a single .asm file
	This feature has been triggered by the fact that traceSM is not displaying multiple files in chronological order
	traceVDIC.sh and trace96x1.sh now supporting 1x Agent's EndpointLog.txt (special SIPMESSAGE format: "End of inbound/outbound SIP message")
	added Konftel 300IP/300IPx into traceB179.sh (introduced vsyslog=30 when there is no 'konfsip' string)
	added Konftel 800 into traceB199.sh (introduced vsyslog=30 in case there was no 'konfsip' string found)
	created traceD200.sh for D200 DECT gateways    
	created traceACME.sh for ACME SBC
	traceAAC.sh now supports logs from AS5300 server

Enhancements:
	alternative distribution link introduced: http://toolsa.sd.avaya.com/~lgyalog/SIPlog2traceSM.tgz
	some linux environment includes 'base64' program which does not accept "--version" option
		1-liner added to workaround this with existing '-b' option
	improved destination file name assignment
	detect if input is a .asm file created by this tool	
	allow new input type such as folder or compressed files (.tgz/.tar/.gz/.zip)
	failsafe sipmsg_header() against missing sipdate, siptime or IP
	safeguard missing 'tshark'
	allow ignoring INFO SIP messages
	accept compressed logfiles (eg sipmcDebug.txt.gz)
	longest SIP msg statistics now shows SIP REQUEST strings
	on statistics report screen, show timestamp of first/last SIP message
	added exception management to the 'date' command
	present 'Server:' info in addition to 'User-Agent:' on statistics screen
	display averege SIP msg conversion rate as well as total time spent on statistics screen

    Enhancement: provide tips if found syslog, based on User-Agent strings, which other traceXXX.sh script could be utilized with this input file
    Enhancement: a packet can include multiple SIP messages (eg. Continuation)
- traceVDI.sh:
    Enhancement: display the Workplace VDI firmware version string on the statistics screen
    Enhancement: adding to message number indicator if SIP msg was split
- traceAAfD.sh:
    Enhancement: implement -A and -C options (convert All files found in logreport and Concatenate outputfiles)

    BugFix: universal time was not extracted properly from message header
    Enhancement: assigned last 3 digits of 3309492437mS to msec variable in timestamp, instead of currently using "000"

- traceXT.sh/traceCU360.sh:
	Bugfix: calculate $rec correctly, ignore sent/recv H323 lines
- traceMCU.sh:
	Bugfix: sipmsec extracted via 'cut' command results in garbage, replaced 'cut' with 'awk'
